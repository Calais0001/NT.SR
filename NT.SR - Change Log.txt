	Hi all, I am back with another project :D
	
	This project will be for people to come to hang out and chill, the world features an
	open environment that gives off a warm summers feel.
	
	At the moment while I sit in Alpha until we hit Beta the world can go public. From
	there when we hit full release will most likely hint the project is complete and minor
	updates will only be released.
