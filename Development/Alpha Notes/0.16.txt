	- OCEAN SHADER
	 *with 0.16, I've provided a full rework of this shader to boost the eye candy
	  for the scene. And what I've done has made this shader no longer look like plastic!
	 *SSR (Screen-Space-Refraction) re-enabled and optimized
	 *tweaked colour (including blend)
	 *tweaked glossiness, metallic and normal map settings
	  (visible texture now looks like actual water)
	 *added static skybox reflection
	 *increased fourier grid size to an acceptable tile size
	 *optimized tessellation settings
	 *optimized blend settings
	 *a fix for seeing a green haze
	 
	- FIXES
	 *when opening any panel at the main user interface the panel will check to make sure all other panels are off to prevent overlapping
	 *fixed bug when clicking BAM it would never come back even if the user declined the prompt
	 *fixed panel highlighting and sizing
	 *fixed some incorrect seat positions and exit positions
	 
	 Due to my absence, all server links, QR codes and my discord name have been checked and updated

	 My unexpected hiatus is over! This update serves as a graphical overhaul and a bug fix release.
	 I've taken the time to sit down and completely overhaul the ocean shader due to receiving several comments about it looking "like plastic". I've played around with cube map settings, gloss and metallic settings, Screen-Space-Refraction and improved the quality of the normal map.

	 Unfortunately due to running out of time, the upgraded version of the mirrors will be delayed until 0.17, about which more info will be provided in my server.
