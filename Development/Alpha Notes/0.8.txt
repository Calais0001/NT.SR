			Build  Version: Alpha 0.8 | Bug Fix Release / Performance Improvement
			Engine Version: Unity 2017.4.15f1
			Release Date: 12/27/2018
	
		Changes:

	- A fix for the ocean reflections
	 *very uncomfortable in VR Devices, the reflections have been disabled for the time being
	- A fix for all trees / bushes / windzone
	 *tweaked windzone settings
	 *corrected which shaders all models should be using (major performance improvement)
	 *trees are now baked into lightmaps but are not static, for some reason when
	  set to static the leaves and bark would be affected by the windzone
	 *a fix for the tree's bark to appear black with no shadows
	 
	 
	 Version point eight brings a significant improvement with the trees.
	 
	 Previously all trees used a shader that uses a Diffuse, Normal, Gloss maps, but only
	 a diffuse map was active therefore bringing down performance.
	 
	 A fix was also made to the tree's being set to static which for some reason
	 caused the entire tree to be affected by the wind zone, this has been fixed
	 and the windzone settings have been tweaked for more realistic movement.

	This may be the last or second last update for 2018.
