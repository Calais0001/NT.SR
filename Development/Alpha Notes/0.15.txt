	- Terrain work
	 *tons of terrain painting
	 *covered the area in trees and grass
	- Mirror in the cabin zone is no longer active by default
	- Added campfire smoke
	 *first attempt at advanced settings for particle systems
	 
	SORRY! for the huge delay with this one, let me explain. first of all, I lost
	2 weeks of work back when i tried to sync this project to my laptop..
	instead, it did it backwards ;_;
	
	Another one is im still working on my avatar before my new VR setup comes in.
	
	Update 0.16 will be released as soon as the cabin zone is 99.9% complete,
	after that i will work on the cabin.

	In this update I've added the Box which players can use using the
	world controls tab at spawn, I've also made little changes to which objects
	get baked such as the trees. this also fixes them being pure black,
	this shouldn't have an impact on performance but if it does i will revert.
	 
	 The cabin zone is nearing completion and i soon will begin making the actual cabin.
	 As of this update the cabin zone is now out of Beta.
	 (can be seen without enabling beta mode)
	 
	 I went ahead and changed some lightmap settings as part of experimenting as well.
