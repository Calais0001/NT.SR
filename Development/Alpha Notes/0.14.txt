			Build  Version: Alpha 0.14 | Cabin / Ambient Occlusion
			Engine Version: Unity 2017.4.15f1
			Release Date: 1/23/2019
	
		Changes:

	- Lighting enhancements near the Main mirror and Cabin mirror
	- Tweaked bend setting for grass movement
	- Ocean screen space Refraction has been disabled for the moment
	- Fixed an issue with the mirror having some strange Z-Fighting
	 *I had accidentally set the position on the wrong axis
	- Fixed an issue with the terrain using the wrong shader
	- Fixed an issue with UI layering
	 
	 BETA MODE ONLY
	- Terrain work
	 *added tons of tree's and bushes around the cabin area
	 *major terrain adjustments to the cabin area
	 *lots of grass
	- Added fences
	- The mirror by the cabin now has a rear shader
	 
	 
	 Baked ambient occlusion has been enabled to the lightmap baking process,
	 this means game objects that don't receive direct sunlight or cracks and crevices
	 will appear darker than most normal shadows.
	 
	 Sorry for the major delay, not a lot of progress in this update due to working--
	 on my avatar, I am still pre-occupied with my avatar so at the moment
	 progress is slow.
	 
	 At the moment to have the ocean curve neatly around the map and off towards the
	 cabin I've had add a second ocean layer, soon I will venture to Blender to
	 hopefully create a custom shape that fits the area.
