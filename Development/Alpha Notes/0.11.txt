	  moved closer to spawn

	 *also slightly shorter
	- Adjusted wind settings for grass and tree's
	- Ocean should no longer appear above the sand
	- Removed the reflection probe for the mirror toggle ball
	- Added QR code for the latest event
	
	
	The User Interface panel is on a fancy welcome sign right next to spawn.
	
	Some info on the Beta Elements panel; this panel is used to reveal in-complete
	work since it adds in-complete assets they may not work or could cause
	performance issues. Once this is enabled it cannot be disabled.
	
	This update is focused on polishing the UI system, its location and visual bugs.
	I've given the main panels a new home right next to spawn and left the mirror
	settings panel right in front of the mirror.
	
	As of now the progress on the cabin has begun and will complete the spawn area,
	once complete the cabin and spawn area or mirror zone is complete I will go
	around polishing and perfecting any rough edges as I prepare for the Games Zones.
