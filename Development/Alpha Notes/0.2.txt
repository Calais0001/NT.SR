			Build  Version: Alpha 0.2 | Terrain Changes / Scenery / Occlusion Culling
			Engine Version: Unity 5.6.1p1
			Release Date: 11/15/2018
	
		Changes:

	- Terrain
	 *off to the right of the mirror I've worked on the thicker side of the forest
	- Occlusion culling enabled
	 *The game is currently optimized well enough to not need heavy OC, settings
	 are minimal
	 *there may be visual bugs but I have pre-ironed them out
	- Adjusted lighting parameters
	- Park bench now can seat 3 people
	 *adjusted to perfection!
	- Fix to foliage going berserk when being manipulated by a windzone
	 *not all have been tuned so there may still be some with this issue
	- Added a area light for the mirror
	 *currently is default ON, i will add a toggle for it soon
	- Enabled fog to simulate a slight blue haze
	
	
	This update brings 3 major factors. 
	
	1 More work to the terrain and a proper idea of the terrain layout
	2 Realism, such as leaves moving in the wind + lighting adjustments
	3 Occlusion culling + world size compression
	
	For the next few updates, I will be heavily focusing on the terrain layout to set
	myself up for small structures that I will build for players to roam around.
	For now the area really only has the park bench and mirror.
