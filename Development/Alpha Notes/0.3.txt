			Build  Version: Alpha 0.3 | Secondary Terrain / Performance Improvements
			Engine Version: Unity 5.6.1p1
			Release Date: 11/17/2018
	
		Changes:

	- Terrain changes
	 *hills to the side with a ocean in front
	 *texture management
	- Secondary terrain added to cover the distance
	- Performance improvements include
	 *grass detail distance lowered
	 *most static objects set to static mode
	 *continued compression to textures and aggressive compression to normals
	 *secondary terrain made lowest renderer priority
	- Some small changes to the fog for better visual appearance
	 *exponential mode
	- Changes to the mirror
	 *the rear of the mirror*
	 *added text
	 
	 
	 This update is exciting, I've completed most of the scenery and only have the spawn
	 area to finish off. At this moment the game is focused to only need very few textures
	 and aggressive compression to keep the world size below 20MB and nothing above 50MB
	 
	 After I complete the spawn area I will partially begin setting myself up for the 
	 little things I'm going to do. 
	 
	 in the meantime I will begin working on the special 
	 buttons for the mirror. 
	 
	 next update won't include any progress on that but I will post 
	 an update soon in the concept plan for what needs to be done.
