	 Hi! This version is massive, there has been a lot of learning curves and 
	 problems I had to face with this version.
	 
	 The first one was correcting the world lighting,
	 its still a work in progress but has been much improved.
	 
	 A few new useful features have been added for development and a 
	 few secrets have also been added too ;)
	 
	 By the way! the world thumbnail is extra pretty, i went and added a few
	 Post Processing components to it.
